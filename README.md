# Boxed Water Landing Page

This landing page is created for a fictional brand called Boxed Water. The brand's main selling point is that it is eco-friendly and refreshing. The website is built using Next.js, a React framework for building server-side rendered websites, which helps to optimize the website for faster loading times.
